# 🪶 AWS S3 Manual End-to-End Project (Root User Guide)

This guide helps you manually create and test **Amazon S3** as the **root user** — step by step.

---

## ☁️ What is S3?
Amazon **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a cloud-based storage system where you can store, access, and manage files such as images, documents, or even host static websites.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Upload an image manually to S3, make it public, and access it via browser.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites
- AWS account (you are using **root user**, so full access is available)
- Internet browser and an image file (e.g., `photo.jpg`)

---

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Guide

### 🟢 Step 1 — Open S3 Console
- Login to **AWS Console**
- Search for **S3** in the top bar
- Click **Create Bucket**

### 🟢 Step 2 — Create a New Bucket
| Setting | Example Value |
|----------|----------------|
| **Bucket name** | `my-root-demo-bucket` (must be unique) |
| **Region** | `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) |
| **Block Public Access** | Uncheck “Block all public access” |
| **Acknowledgement** | Check warning box |
| **Versioning** | Optional |

Click **Create bucket**.

---

### 🟢 Step 3 — Upload an Image
1. Open your new bucket
2. Click **Upload**
3. Select your image file (e.g., `photo.jpg`)
4. Click **Upload**

Your file is now stored in S3.

---

### 🟢 Step 4 — Make It Public
1. Click on your uploaded image → go to **Permissions**
2. Under **Access Control List (ACL)** → click **Edit**
3. In **Public access**, select **Everyone (public)** for “Read” permission
4. Save changes

✅ The image is now publicly viewable.

---

### 🟢 Step 5 — Copy and Test the Image URL
1. Copy the **Object URL**, e.g.:
   ```
   https://my-root-demo-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg
   ```
2. Open it in your browser → you should see your image 🎉

---

### 🟢 (Optional) Step 6 — Host a Static Website
If you upload an HTML file (`index.html`), you can make your bucket a simple website.

**Enable Static Website Hosting:**
1. Go to **Properties → Static website hosting**
2. Choose **Enable**
3. Set **Index document:** `index.html`
4. Save changes

Now open your website endpoint:
```
http://my-root-demo-bucket.s3-website-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
```

✅ Your website is live.

---

## 🧾 Example index.html (optional)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>S3 Root User Demo</title></head>
  <body style="text-align:center; font-family:Arial;">
    <h1>🚀 Welcome to My S3 Demo Website</h1>
    <p>This page is hosted from my S3 bucket using the root user.</p>
    <img src="photo.jpg" width="300" alt="My uploaded image">
  </body>
</html>
```

Upload this `index.html` file along with `photo.jpg` into your bucket.

---

### 🧹 Step 7 — Clean Up
When finished testing:
1. Delete files inside the bucket
2. Delete the bucket

or via CLI:
```bash
aws s3 rb s3://my-root-demo-bucket --force
```

---
