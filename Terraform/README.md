Master Terraform from the ground up — from installation and setup to advanced concepts like modules, workspaces, and security. This course provides real-world examples and hands-on experience for building, managing, and scaling infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

---

## 🚀 1: Getting Started with Terraform

### 🧩 Introduction to Terraform and IaC
Learn the **fundamentals of Terraform** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.  
Understand why Terraform is essential for modern infrastructure management and how IaC automates provisioning.

### 💻 Installing Terraform (MacOS, Linux, Windows)
Follow step-by-step instructions to install Terraform on **MacOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows** — complete with commands and verification tips.

### ☁️ Setting up Terraform for AWS
Configure Terraform to work with **AWS**.  
Learn how to set up AWS credentials, configure the AWS provider, and prepare to deploy cloud resources.

### ✍️ Writing Your First Terraform Code
Start writing Terraform code from scratch.  
Understand the **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**, learn about Terraform configuration files, and define your first AWS resource.

### 🔁 Terraform Lifecycle Explained
Understand the **Terraform lifecycle commands**:  
- `terraform init` – Initialize configuration  
- `terraform plan` – Preview changes  
- `terraform apply` – Deploy infrastructure  

### 🖥️ Launching Your First EC2 Instance
Provision an **AWS EC2 instance** with Terraform.  
Learn about AMIs, instance types, tags, and public IPs — and watch your first infrastructure come to life.

### 📂 Terraform State Basics
Understand the role of the **Terraform state file** (`terraform.tfstate`).  
Learn how Terraform tracks current vs. desired infrastructure and ensures consistency across deployments.

---

## ⚙️ 2: Advanced Terraform Configuration

### 🌐 Understanding Providers and Resources
Dive deeper into **providers** (like AWS, Azure, GCP) and **resources** that define your infrastructure components.

### 🧮 Variables and Outputs
Use **variables** for dynamic configurations and **outputs** to expose key information such as instance IPs or IDs.

### 🧠 Conditional Expressions and Functions
Add logic to your Terraform code with **conditional statements** and explore **built-in functions** for strings, numbers, and lists.

### 🧰 Debugging and Formatting Terraform Files
Learn how to **debug errors** and use `terraform fmt` for clean, consistent, and readable Terraform files.

---

## 🧱 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Modules

### 📦 Creating Reusable Terraform Modules
Modularize your code for reusability and better organization.  
Learn to create, structure, and call modules efficiently.

### 🔗 Local Values and Data Sources
Simplify expressions using **local values** and use **data sources** to fetch data from existing AWS resources or external systems.

### 🧩 Using Variables and Inputs with Modules
Pass variables into modules for customization.  
Understand how inputs make modules flexible and reusable.

### 📤 Leveraging Outputs from Modules
Use **module outputs** to extract and reuse important data across configurations.

### 🌍 Exploring Terraform Registry
Discover the **Terraform Registry**, explore pre-built community modules, and integrate them into your own projects.

---

## 🤝 4: Collaboration and State Management

### 🧭 Collaborating with Git and Version Control
Learn to use **Git** for version control — clone, pull, and push your Terraform projects to collaborate effectively with teams.

### 🔒 Handling Sensitive Data and `.gitignore`
Protect sensitive information.  
Understand the importance of `.gitignore` and best practices for keeping secrets out of repositories.

### 🪣 Introduction to Terraform Backends
Discover **Terraform backends** for remote state storage.  
Learn why remote state management is critical for collaboration.

### ☁️ Implementing S3 Backend for State Storage
Configure an **AWS S3 bucket** as a Terraform backend to store and share your remote state files securely.

### 🧱 State Locking with DynamoDB
Prevent conflicts using **state locking** with DynamoDB.  
Understand how it ensures consistency during team deployments.

---

## ⚡ 5: Provisioning and Provisioners

### 🛠️ Understanding Provisioners
Learn about **provisioners**, tools that execute scripts or actions on resources during creation or destruction.

### 🧑‍💻 Remote-exec and Local-exec Provisioners
Differentiate between:
- `remote-exec` – runs commands on remote machines  
- `local-exec` – runs commands locally  

### 🔄 Applying Provisioners at Creation and Destruction
Implement provisioners to run at specific lifecycle events — during creation, update, or destruction.

### 🚨 Handling Provisioner Failures
Handle failures gracefully with retries, timeouts, and the `on_failure` attribute.

---

## 🌱 6: Managing Environments with Workspaces

### 🧭 Introduction to Workspaces
Learn what **Terraform workspaces** are and how they help manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, stage, prod).

### 🔄 Creating and Switching Workspaces
Use `terraform workspace new` and `terraform workspace select` to create and switch environments easily.

### 🌐 Using Workspaces for Environment Management
Understand how workspaces help isolate configurations and maintain separate state files for each environment.

---

## 🔐 7: Security and Advanced Topics

### 🏦 HashiCorp Vault Overview
Get introduced to **HashiCorp Vault**, a secure tool for managing secrets, credentials, and encryption keys.

### 🤝 Integrating Terraform with Vault
Integrate Vault with Terraform to **securely store and access secrets** like API keys and passwords during provisioning.

---

✅ **Next Step:**  
Move to hands-on labs where you’ll practice each concept with real AWS examples and build a fully automated cloud environment.
